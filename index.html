 	<h3>About Me</h3>

	<p>Welcome to my website! I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison pursuing a major in Journalism with a certificate in Digital Media Studies and Business. I am  undecided in concentrations between Broadcast and Reporting and Strategic Communication. Nevertheless, I am interested in exploring a wide span of issues in news media. Topics I find particularly engaging are protest coverage, international relations, women's issues, and cultural patterns in the entertainment industry</p>

 	<p>Growing up in New York City, I was privileged enough to be exposed to the hustle and bustle of a large cosmopolitan city. Attending a highschool located in Times Square I was in the epicenter of working professionals, Broadway stars, statistics about crime and homelessness, political TED talks, and international conferences daily. Something different was occuring on every avenue and the news organizations headquarters were all at the frontlines of the action.</p>

	<p>Now residing in Madison, I  miss the pace of Manhattan and how news permeates the city blocks. However, I have found that same hustle mentality among my peers at this University through everyoneâ€™s desire to be involved in something greater than themselves. With the pandemic last year and most clubs being online it was difficult as  a first year student to find outlets in a completely new environment far away from home. But through clubs like Moda Magazine, my sorority and community fundraising events, and simply exploring the Madison landscape I have been able to transport my hobbies and passions all the way from the Big Apple to the midwest. So click the tabs if you want to learn a little bit more about me and my experience in Madison thus far!</p>
