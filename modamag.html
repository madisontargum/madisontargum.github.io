		<h1>Moda Magazine</h1>

		<p>Moda Magazine is a premiere life & style magazine curated by students for students. It is a place where creatives from all mediums - graphic design, photography and of course writers - come together to produce intricately planned, unique themed issues. Its print and online platform creates an inclusive space where teams can work on creative direction as well as enable new members to get involved on their different platforms. Perosnally, I am drawn to writing about pieces pertaining to the projection of cultural norms and pop culuture trends. Through the arts, culture, and lifestyle sections I am starting to find the stories I want to explore as a writer. Additionally, I am getting more involved with the InDesign layout process and aiding the creative director in behind the scenes of Moda which is super exciting!</p>

		<h2> My Moda Roadmap</h2>

		<p> My first ever piece I wrote for Moda was for online, exploring the stark differences in themes portrayed in 2000s teen media versus modern television shows. Entitled "Embellished Lifestyles vs Raw Reality: New Standards for Young Adult TV," I wanted readers to understand how we cultivate certain beliefs about the world around us by the worlds we see on our television screens by comparing and contrasting hit shows Gossip Girl and Euphoria. Both of these shows were iconic for their portrayals of sex, drugs, and the struggles of growing up but one glorifying a lifestyle not so attainable to all viewers and one more accesible. As my first official Moda piece, it holds a special place in my heart. Linked below!</p>

		<p> My next contribution was a collaboration article focusing on "The Male Gaze in Media: How Catering to Men's Desires Define Feminity Across Media" featured in Moda's February issue Plastic. Plastic was a issue that's visual composition played with feminity and conent challanged writers to investigate how society defines feminity in addition to how we can change outdated concepts to feel a sense of individuality. With a fellow Moda writer we wanted to write an article that highlighted the multiple ways women are exploited in everyday forms of media such as quick sex scenes in film or how female characters are projected in video games.

		<p>The following April issue "Oasis" encompasses all the colors of relief and refuge. As writers we were encouraged to write in a way that would provide you with feelings of optimism and escape. This is why I chose to write in arts and research one of my favorite artists Frida Kahlo used her art as an oasis from personal struggle. Linked below!</p>

	    <p>Continuing Moda as a sophomore, I have been able to be a part of the production of the October issue HEX. This theme obviously was supposed to be emblematic of the vibes of October: enchanting, bewitching, and spooky. In my article "Is It in the Cards for Us All: How Lack of Representation in Tarot Limits Access to Spirituality," I chose to explore how the visual art in tarot cards is limiting to who is encouraged to engage in spiritual practices.
