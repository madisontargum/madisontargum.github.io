			<h3>Travel</h3>
	<p>One thing that I am grateful to have had the opprotunity to do is travel. Starting at young age my parents instilled in my brother and I that if you have the opprotunity to see the world, do it. So far I have been to some of the Carribean Islands, Mexico, Italy, and Spain. Spain was by far my favorite trip because I did a language immersion program and stayed with a host family. The program was also in Northern spain where I was able to explore Basque culinary culture, attend San Fermines in Pamplona and gained an entire new family across the globe. Before the pandemic, I was supposed to go on a tour around Japan so that continues to be one of my dream destinations in addition to Sigapore, Portugal, Greece, France, and England. Next year I hope to study second semester in either Barcelona or London and take some classes abroad!</p>

	Music 
	<p>Music has always been a huge passion of my mine. Making playlists has always been a cathartic release for me. Some of my favorite artists at the moment include Dominic Fike, Still Woozy, Noah Kahan, and . But I will gladly rewind the playbutton on albums by Fleetwood Mac, Amy Whinehosue, and Adele and listen to these artists for hours. Simply the music production process fascinates me and I crave to understand the process of songwriting lyricism. <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/favorites-the-moment/pl.u-6mo4aW8hBV5Y5a"> Click to find one of my playlists!</a></p>

	Art
	<p>Art and creativity has always run in my family. My nana is an esteem sculpturist who has made decadent gold pieces and bronzed clay pieces. Inspired by her, I started exploring my interest in fine arts and painting classes in high shcool. In a portfolio development class I took senior year I was required ro travel around the city to different museums and galleries to take classes that would get me out of my comfort zone as well as challenge my skills such as nude painting and glass blowing. These were not my strong suits and I eventually fell in love with acrylic and oil paints.</p>
