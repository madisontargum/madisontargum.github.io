		<h3>Courses</h3>

		<p>In the fall of 2020 I was able to take part in a First Year Interest Group (FIG) that prompted me to take three courses under the umbrella term of "Social Media Texts" where we analyzed the impacts of digital culture and social media on our present realities.</p>
		<dl><dt>ENG 178</dt>
				<dd>In English 178, Professor Ainehi Edoro focused on analyzing old literature and writing styles to how we format writing on social media platforms and within our digital communities. One of my personal highlights of the class were writing a dissertation on the dichotomy of social media in prompting entertainment yet fostering an environment of political enagement and activism.</dd>
				<dt>SOC 134</dt>
				<dd>In Sociology 134, Professor Pedriana taught us to look at the racial constructs in American systems and how the projection of certain stereotypes in the media sustain false ideals of equality.</dd>
				<dt>CA 155</dt>
				<dd>The third class was ultimately my favorite and most applicable to this assignment, Comm Arts 155 "Introduction to Digital Media Production" with Professor Eric Hoyt. Last year, I was exposed to some HTML coding to create my own food blog, created my own podcast and even a short film on life during the pandemic.</dd>
